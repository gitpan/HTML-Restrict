HTML-Restrict

This module uses HTML::Parser to strip HTML from text in a restrictive manner.
By default all HTML is restricted.  You may alter the default behaviour by
supplying your own tag rules.

For example.

	use HTML::Restrict;

	my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new();

	# use default rules to start with (strip away all HTML)
	my $processed = $hr->process('<b>i am bold</b>');

	# $processed now equals: i am bold

Now, a less restrictive example:

	use HTML::Restrict;

	my $hr = HTML::Restrict->new();
	$hr->set_rules({
		b   => [],
		img => [qw( src alt / )]
	});

	my $html = q[<body><b>hello</b> <img src="pic.jpg" alt="me" id="test" /></body>];
	my $processed = $hr->process( $html );

	# $processed now equals: <b>hello</b> <img src="pic.jpg" alt="me" />
