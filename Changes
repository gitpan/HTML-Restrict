Revision history for HTML-Restrict

2.0.0   2013-02-27
        - Bumps version to 2.0.0 due to new features breaking backwards
          compatibility.
        - Forces all tag rules to be provided in lower case.  Breaks
          backcompat, but mixed or upper case rules would have been silently
          ignored.  So, this is really a bug fix.
        - Strips content between script tags by default. Breaks backcompat,
          but the default behaviour was likely not what anyone wanted.
        - Strips content between style tags by default.  Breaks backcompat,
          but the default behaviour was likely not what anyone wanted.
        - Adds Pod for previously undocumented allow_comments,
          allow_declaration and strip_enclosed_content.
        - Ensures stripper stack is always reset (perlpong).
        - Protects against undef string comparison (perlpong).
        - Checks URI scheme for src attributes (perlpong).
        - Removes accessor/mutator documentation.  Would prefer if all params
          were set at object instatiation.
        - Adds ridiculously basic example script.

        - Adds (undocumented) allow_comments() and allow_declartion() methods

            (Duncan Forsyth)

0.05    2010-02-03

            warnings about uninitialized vars.

0.03    2009-11-17
        - process() no longer dies when passed an undef -- patch provided by
            Mark Jubenville (ioncache)

0.02    2009-09-17
        - Improved documentation layout and clarity
